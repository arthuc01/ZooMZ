**Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry (ZooMS)** is a peptide mass fingerprinting approach that enables rapid taxonomic identification of archaeological bone and other collagen-bearing materials using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF MS). Since its introduction, ZooMS has become a widely adopted tool in archaeology, palaeontology, and cultural heritage science, providing a cost-effective and minimally destructive alternative to DNA-based methods for species identification, particularly in contexts where DNA preservation is poor or sample throughput is high.

The ZooMS workflow exploits sequence variation in type I collagen, the dominant protein in bone, dentine, and ivory. Following collagen extraction and enzymatic digestion—typically using trypsin—the resulting peptide mixture is analysed by MALDI-ToF MS to generate a mass spectrum composed of reproducible peptide ions. A subset of these ions, commonly referred to as diagnostic markers, correspond to peptides whose masses vary in a taxon-specific manner due to amino-acid substitutions in the collagen sequence. By comparing the observed peptide mass fingerprint to reference marker sets, unknown samples can be assigned to taxonomic groups ranging from family to species level, depending on marker resolution and reference coverage.

One of the principal strengths of ZooMS lies in its robustness and scalability. The method requires only small amounts of material, can be applied to highly degraded samples, and is compatible with large-scale screening studies involving hundreds or thousands of specimens. As a result, ZooMS has been used extensively to address questions spanning zooarchaeology, palaeoecology, conservation biology, and the study of worked osseous artefacts, including parchments, bone tools, and ivory objects. In many cases, ZooMS serves as an efficient triage method, identifying samples of particular interest for subsequent high-resolution analyses such as ancient DNA sequencing.

Despite its widespread uptake, ZooMS data analysis has historically relied on a combination of manual inspection, ad hoc scripts, and semi-automated tools. Core analytical steps—including spectral preprocessing, peak picking, marker matching, and confidence assessment—are often implemented using bespoke pipelines that vary between laboratories. This heterogeneity can hinder reproducibility, complicate cross-study comparisons, and raise barriers for new users, particularly those without specialist mass spectrometry expertise. Furthermore, the increasing volume of ZooMS data generated by high-throughput studies places growing demands on transparent, robust, and user-friendly computational approaches.
